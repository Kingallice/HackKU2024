## Inspiration
Recently, the grocery store that one of friends works at lost power twice within a short period of time.  This led to the grocery store have to coordinate with their local food bank to transfer and distribute all of the refrigerated food before it spoiled. We wanted to build an system to streamline the process for both the stores donating the food and the food banks distributing it.

## What it does
NourishNET is a web application to connect food banks to grocers and other food vendors looking to donate food.  The app allows stores to post offers of different food items for the different food banks to accept.  The food banks can also post different requests that stores can accept and fulfill.

## How we built it
We used ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web stack; MongoDB Atlas for the database; and GitHub for version control.

## Challenges we ran into
Two of our three group members have not previously used ASP.NET, so it took some time to get acclimated.  

## Accomplishments that we're proud of


## What we learned
We learned ASP.NET, MongoDB, and C#.  

## What's next for NourishNET
We would like to continue to build out the dashboards and add more features.
